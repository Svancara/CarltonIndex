   Hi Carlton!
  </h2> 
  
   <p>
    Your Excel represents something different. Either you want something else than before or you made some errors in your Excel.
   </p>
    

<ol>
<li>
   <p>
    Calculations you made in the first several columns on the left, can be found after the column "SMA calcs ->" on the right side in my Excel file.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am using a shortcut "SMA" (Simple Moving Average) in such columns.
   </p>
   <p>
    So it seems you are concentrated just to the "averaged leverage data" and not interested in the "plain leverage" algorithm. Correct?
   </p>
   
   <p>I am talking about these results:</p>
   <p>
    <img src="ColumnsInResultsPages.png" alt="ColumnsInResultsPages.png, 49kB" title="ColumnsInResultsPages" height="656" width="817">
   </p>
</li>
<li><p>
     In your Excel: Columns E,F,G and H are not used in calculation after the column "I - Now calculating Bob/Carlton SD method". 
    It looks like an error, because it means you are not using Leverage data from the column C anywhere after the column I.
    </p>    
   </li>
<li>
 <p>
  Column J: You are using SD of daily returns (SD of the column "D Return-Raw").
 </p> 
 <p>
  I used SD of SMA(Levergae,7) instead. [You have that average in the column E in the formula =IF(C9<>0,D9/AVERAGE(C3:C9),0))]
 </p>
 <p>
  Let me know which is correct. If SD of daily returns or SD of SMA(Leverage,7)  
 </p> 
 </li>
 <li>
    <p>
     You have an error in column N ("180 Day Ret - SD"). It uses the column "L" in the formula: =L184/L4-1.
    </p>    
    <p>
     It should use column M.
    </p>
    <p>
     I changed that in the Excel I am returning to you. I added a new column "O" with the formuls =M231/M52-1 
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>However, there is a substantial change there too.</b> When I calculated rolling 180, 210, 240 and 270 days data, I used AVERAGE of the 180,...,270 days. 
    </p>
         <p>
          For example: =AVERAGE(I31:I210)
         </p>    
         <p>
          But you are using "Rate-of-Change" (just like for daily returns). For example: =L231/L52-1  
         </p>
         <p>
          So I need to know what you want. Either awerage or "Rate-of-Change". 
         </p>
 </li>
</ol>
   
   <p>
    Carlton, I changed my software and I do have a version which calculates the same results as in your Excel. I added those results to the column "P".
   </p>
   <p>
    But I want to ask you to verify it is worth to run (about 3 hours) and generate a final HTML pages (which would need some other changes in this version of my software.)
